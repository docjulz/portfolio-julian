This is my personal web developer portfolio

## About

I have been a web developer for several years and am finally getting around to organizing my work in a portfolio rather than simply hosting my code on GitHub.

## Frameworks and Language Used

I wanted to demonstrate my understanding with web technology so I used React, NextJS(13) and Tailwinds to design and code this project. These technologies made the process very simple and intuitive.

### Why React?

React is becoming more and more popular among web developers and I love learning about this technology. Learning React has been a challenge, but I love using components and really like how simple creating components is now.

### Why NextJS

I initially found NextJS when it came to routing and to move awayy from React Router. I am using the 13th edition and making specific note of this becuase NextJS 13 is a big leap forward and impletents new formating and Image configuration. I also like how it pairs with Vercel to deploy applications.

### Why Tailwind

I love styling websites with this technology. it is so intuitive, and I like how quickly I can see changes. While ill always love CSS I find myself using this extension more and more. I like how lightweight it is and how simple it is to customize as well.
